    "8.13. Implementing Knight’s Tour\n",
    "The search algorithm we will use to solve the knight’s tour problem is called depth first search (DFS). Whereas the breadth first search algorithm discussed in the previous section builds a search tree one level at a time, a depth first search creates a search tree by exploring one branch of the tree as deeply as possible. In this section we will look at two algorithms that implement a depth first search. The first algorithm we will look at directly solves the knight’s tour problem by explicitly forbidding a node to be visited more than once. The second implementation is more general, but allows nodes to be visited more than once as the tree is constructed. The second version is used in subsequent sections to develop additional graph algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "The depth first exploration of the graph is exactly what we need in order to find a path that has exactly 63 edges. We will see that when the depth first search algorithm finds a dead end (a place in the graph where there are no more moves possible) it backs up the tree to the next deepest vertex that allows it to make a legal move.\n",
    "\n",
    "The knightTour function takes four parameters: n, the current depth in the search tree; path, a list of vertices visited up to this point; u, the vertex in the graph we wish to explore; and limit the number of nodes in the path. The knightTour function is recursive. When the knightTour function is called, it first checks the base case condition. If we have a path that contains 64 vertices, we return from knightTour with a status of True, indicating that we have found a successful tour. If the path is not long enough we continue to explore one level deeper by choosing a new vertex to explore and calling knightTour recursively for that vertex.\n",
    "\n",
    "DFS also uses colors to keep track of which vertices in the graph have been visited. Unvisited vertices are colored white, and visited vertices are colored gray. If all neighbors of a particular vertex have been explored and we have not yet reached our goal length of 64 vertices, we have reached a dead end. When we reach a dead end we must backtrack. Backtracking happens when we return from knightTour with a status of False. In the breadth first search we used a queue to keep track of which vertex to visit next. Since depth first search is recursive, we are implicitly using a stack to help us with our backtracking. When we return from a call to knightTour with a status of False, in line 11, we remain inside the while loop and look at the next vertex in nbrList.\n",
